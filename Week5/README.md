# Week 4

## Loops
Loops let us do the same thing several times. This is VERY USEFUL in games! 
Think about it! If you're attacking an enemy, you're doing the same thing 
over and over again, until someone is out of HP! You attack, then they attack. 
Then you attack, then they attack. It's a loop!

## Game improvements
We add some attack options to Mario's character. The user can choose how to attack the enemy!
