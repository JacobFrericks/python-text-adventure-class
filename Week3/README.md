# Week 3

## Objects
Lets add Mario HP to the game. What would we need to do? Well, we would have to set it up like we did for mario_coins last week. That's a lot of work! What if we had a "mario" object that was in charge of keeping track of mario?

## Functions
Functions allow us to reuse common code. For instance, if we wanted to add 2+2, 3+3 and 4+4, we could make an "add" function that could take two parameters and add them together. We would then call that function three times with the necessary numbers! Otherwise we would have to rewrite the "adding" three times.
