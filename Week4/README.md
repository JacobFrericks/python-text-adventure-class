# Week 4

## Review
Lets look back on everything we have learned!

## Lists
Lists are just a way to store multiple items in one variable. Say I wanted to store all of mario's attack possibilities. I could have several variables `attack_1` and `attack_2`, etc, but that would be painful to add another attack! What if we just had one variable that we could add and remove as we pleased?
Enter lists! We could just have one variable `attacks = [attack1, attack2]`. Then when we needed to add another attack, we could just add `attack3` to the end of the list and that's it!
