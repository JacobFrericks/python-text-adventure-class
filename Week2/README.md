# Week 2

## Objectives
Learn about random numbers, user input and objects

## Random Numbers
What if instead of a specific number of coins lost per door, it was a random number? It would make the game less predictable, and more fun! It would be different every time you played it!

## User input
Right now, we choose what door we want by code. But that doesn't make it playable by anyone except us! So lets make it so other people could play it!

## Objects
Lets add Mario HP to the game. What would we need to do? Well, we would have to set it up like we did for mario_coins last week. That's a lot of work! What if we had a "mario" object that was in charge of keeping track of mario?
